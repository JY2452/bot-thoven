# Bot-thoven

This repository contains the code for the Bot-thoven Project, a xylophone-playing robot that I built during my Senior Year in High School. I worked on this project with my friend David Cha. My individual responsibilities included familiarizing myself with the ARDUINO platform â€“ a microcontroller that we used to program the motors of our robot.

One servo motor was used for each key on the xylophone. A xylophone mallet was attached to this motor, and I programmed the motor to rotate to the appropriate value, in order to strike the xylophone key and play the desired note.

The [Starter Code](bot-thoven_starter.ino) that I wrote for this project is included in this repository. This program facilitates controlling the servo motors to play each individual note for the project. The code can be modified appropriately based on the tune that the user wishes the xylophone-playing robot to perform.
